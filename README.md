# Stress Less

This is my graduation project for MSc in Computational Science - server application written in Java using Spring framework incorporates computational models and algorithms written in Matlab to provide personalized simulation of individual's stress levels and stresss reduction therapies.

The manuscript itself is located in the root folder next to the source codes.

## Abstract

Stress has been seen as a negative factor which affects every person's life quality and decision making. To help avoiding of extreme emotions caused by external stressor, a number of practices have been introduced - in the scope of this study we take into account three therapy kinds: mindfulness, humour and music therapy. We aim to study how in fact various practices help people to cope with stress, using mathematical modelling. 

We come up with a practical implementation in a form of a client-server software, incorporating the computational model which describes therapy effects for overcoming stress based on quantitative neuropsychological research. The application objective is to help users overcome stressful events in their life while collecting empirical data to support further research and model development. The underlying network model simulates the elicitation of an extreme stressful emotion due to a strong stress-inducing event as an external stimuli, following then with a therapy practice simulation leading to a reduction of the stress level. Each simulation is based on user input and preferences, integrating a parameter tuning process, it fits a simulation for a particular user.
